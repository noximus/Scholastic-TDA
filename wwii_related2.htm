        <h3><em>Early Sunday Morning: The Pearl Harbor Diary of Amber Billows, Hawaii, 1941</em></h3>
        
		<p>If you had witnessed a major world war only a few decades earlier, would you want your country to enter another one? Probably not. That’s why many Americans wanted to remain uninvolved in the war raging in Europe since 1939. They had lived through World War I, and they were determined not to have another war that spanned the globe. This all changed on the morning of December 7, 1941, when Japanese planes attacked a U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While most of the personnel at the U.S. naval base slept, a Japanese naval task force approached undetected through the darkness. From the decks of its aircraft carriers, a wave of 189 fighters and bombers took off, and then split into two attack groups. One group bombed the air bases at Hickam Field, Wheeler Field, and Ford Island. The other attacked the American naval fleet. </p>
        
        <p>In less than two hours, the Japanese destroyed the heart of the U.S. Pacific fleet. Five of its eight battleships were sunk or crippled. In all, 19 warships were hit and 2,086 U.S. naval officers and seamen killed. The U.S. Army lost 237 men, the use of its air bases, and a large part of its air force.</p>
        
        <p>The unprovoked attack on American soil showed Americans how vulnerable they were and unified the nation in support of entering the war. On December 8, the United States declared war against Japan. Three days later, Germany and Italy declared war against the United States. </p>
        
        <p>For Americans, the war changed the way they lived their everyday lives. People used less electricity and rationed their food in order to save resources for the war effort. Since so many men were fighting and so many weapons were needed, more women went to work than ever before. Women entered jobs once held only by men, such as positions in steel and rubber factories. With so much production necessary, America’s entrance into the war finally lifted the nation’s economy out of the Depression. Now everyone who wanted a job could have one.</p>
        
        <br/>
        <h3>Meet Amber Billows<h3>
        <p>Amber Billows was the daughter of a reporter whose newspaper had sent him to cover events in Hawaii. Amber and her family lived near the naval base at Pearl Harbor. Read her reactions to what President Roosevelt called the “day that will live in infamy.” </p>
        
        <p><em>It looked like the entire fleet had been destroyed. All of Pearl Harbor was in flames, and the harbor itself was a lake of fire. The beach was littered with the limp bodies of men who had been washed ashore.</em></p>

<p><em>Everyone was running all over the place. It was the first time many of the men had seen any real action. When Dad said this, he put his head in his hands for a few seconds. I looked quickly at Mom and could see she was trying not to cry.</em></p>

<p><em>Some of the men became unglued, other panicked, and still others were frozen with fear. Some of the men were badly burned from swimming in the scalding water trying to save themselves and their buddies. Others, heroically, refused to abandon their antiaircraft guns, ignoring the flames that were about to engulf them. Many risked their lives going below decks to help their trapped crewmates.</em></p>
