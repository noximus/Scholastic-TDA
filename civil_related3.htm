        <h3><em>The Journal of James Edmond Pease: A Civil War Union Soldier, Virginia, 1863</em></h3>
        
		<p>Over two million men served as soldiers in the Union army during the Civil War. Some of these soldiers were drafted, but a number of them volunteered. They volunteered because they felt it was their duty to defend the Union, but they also volunteered because they got caught up in "war fever." An estimated 800,000 soldiers were 17 years old or younger. They had lied about their age to join because they wanted to be a part of what they thought would be a brief but glorious adventure. Perhaps they thought that army life would be an exciting alternative to their daily lives and daily chores.</p>
        
        <p>No matter what their reason for joining the war, the Civil War changed the boys who fought in it. But, like the Union, those who survived came out stronger for their scars and wiser for their experiences.</p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <h3>Meet James Edmond Pease</h3>
        <p>James Edmond Pease, an orphan, had nowhere to turn and little to lose so he joined the Union army. He kept the journal of his Company and recorded their experiences in battle against the Confederate "Reb" army.</p>

        <p><em>I have to admit to being very nervous as we entered the woods. I even started to have trouble breathing and had to take in little gulps of air, but I kept moving forward by watching the man in front of me and dashed ahead whenever he did. My breathing settled down some and was almost normal when I saw something move out of the corner of my eye.</em></p>

        <p><em>I was sure I had a Reb located - maybe 400 feet away - and I pointed my musket at the tree near his position. I was holding steady, aiming, finger on the trigger, when I heard the loud crack of a shot out of the many that was crackling around me and then the wooshing sound of the ball coming at me.</em></p>

        <p><em>I know this does not seem possible but stranger things have happened in this strange war and I know what I heard, so I ducked and just then the ball sent my forage cap sailing. I was so startled I just sat there on the ground, staring at my cap with its new ventilation hole thru [sic?] the band and wondering what that ball would have done to my head if I hadn't moved.</em></p>
